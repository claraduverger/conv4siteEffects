# conv4siteEffects
This is an implementation of the procedure "Convolution: AF(f) Dependent on Sra(f)" in Bazzurro and Cornell (2004).
This is an "alpha" version, it needs to be tested, use at your own risk.

The file ground_response_inp_out.zip contains a set of csv files with ground motions, which you can use to test the code.

Use the following link to download an hdf5 file that you can use to test the code:
